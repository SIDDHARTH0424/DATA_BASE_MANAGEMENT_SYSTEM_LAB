# SQL Practicals Repository

This repository contains SQL scripts for a series of practical exercises covering fundamental to intermediate database concepts and SQL operations.

## üìö Overview

The practicals explore SQL concepts from basic table creation and data manipulation to advanced topics like subqueries, joins, functions, procedures, triggers, and ODBC connectivity.

## üìÅ Contents

- `practical_1_database.sql`  
  Creates the database schema, including tables like `Product`, `Supplier`, `Customer`, `Warehouse`, `Purchase_Order`, `Sales_Order`, `Inventory_Transaction`, `User_Table`, and `Reports`.

- `practical_2_basic_queries.sql`  
  Populates tables with `INSERT` statements and includes `ALTER TABLE`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations.

- `practical_3_sql_functions.sql`  
  Demonstrates SQL functions, joins (`INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL OUTER`), subqueries with `EXISTS`, `NOT EXISTS`, and aggregate functions.

- `practical_4_queries_with_operators.sql`  
  Focuses on SQL operators such as `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, and `IN`.

- `practical_5_subqueries_joins_aggregate_functions.sql`  
  Explores complex subqueries, joins, aggregate functions, and includes `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `ALTER TABLE`, and `CREATE VIEW`.

- `practical_6_simple_program.sql`  
  PL/SQL examples including basic messages, `IF` statements, and loop structures (`FOR`, `WHILE`).

- `practical_7_function.sql`  
  A PL/SQL function that converts a decimal number to binary.

- `practical_8_procedure.sql`  
  A PL/SQL procedure for transferring funds between customer accounts.

- `practical_9_trigger.sql`  
  A database trigger that verifies stock availability before inserting sales orders.

- `practical_10_odbc.txt`  
  Overview of ODBC (Open Database Connectivity), its components, setup steps, use cases, and supported tools.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Set up your RDBMS:**  
   Use any SQL-compatible system like Oracle, MySQL, or PostgreSQL.

2. **Execute scripts in sequence:**
   - Start with `practical_1_database.sql` to create tables.
   - Then use `practical_2_basic_queries.sql` to insert and manipulate data.
   - Follow with practicals 3‚Äì9 to explore advanced SQL and PL/SQL concepts.
   - Read `practical_10_odbc.txt` to learn about ODBC setup and use.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By working through this repository, you'll learn to:

- Create and manage databases and tables.
- Perform data manipulation with `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
- Write effective `SELECT` queries with various operators and conditions.
- Use joins and subqueries to retrieve complex data.
- Apply aggregate functions and `GROUP BY`, `HAVING` clauses.
- Write PL/SQL programs, functions, and procedures.
- Implement database triggers.
- Understand and configure ODBC connectivity.
